This repository contains the source codes for MBDS interview tests. For questions that require the explanation of the solutions, I add the explanation in the README file in that folder of that question. Also the screen shots of explanation is attached to the answer sheet.

The codes were implemented with python. The code for each question can be found in the folder of that question and it is in the file with the name “Q+Question_Number.py” (e.g. "Q1.py").

Due to the limited time, I only answered the questions that I was sure about and that were not beyond my expertise.
